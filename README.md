# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Module 13 JavaScript & APIs

## Overview
The DISASTER REPORTING NETWORK is a non-profit company that uses data-driven disaster accounts and narratives from the world.  As a Data Visualization Specialist there, you create insightful visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world.  You do this by supporting and developing website and mobile applications that use the latest GeoJSON earthquake data from the U.S. Geological Survey.  Using this information, the creation of an interactive world map with markers that reflect the size and magnitude of earthquakes by equating that with the diameter size and color gradient of the markers is your current project.  They will also have pop-ups with earthquake location and magnitude being displayed.
